Queue
------

Definition:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where the element added first is removed first.

Operations:
1. Enqueue - Adding an element to the rear of the queue.
2. Dequeue - Removing an element from the front of the queue.
3. Peek/Front - Viewing the front element without removing it.
4. IsEmpty - Checking if the queue is empty.
5. IsFull - Checking if the queue is full (in case of a bounded queue).

Applications:
1. Managing requests in a printer queue.
2. Handling processes in CPU scheduling.
3. Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graph traversal.
4. Data buffering (e.g., IO Buffers, Network Buffers).
5. Call center systems to manage customer service requests.

Examples:
1. Queue of people waiting in line.
2. Task scheduling in operating systems.
3. Message queues in distributed systems.

Types:
1. Simple Queue - Basic FIFO queue.
2. Circular Queue - Connects the rear to the front to utilize unused space.
3. Priority Queue - Elements are dequeued based on priority, not just FIFO.
4. Double-Ended Queue (Deque) - Allows insertion and deletion from both ends.
