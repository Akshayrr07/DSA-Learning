Greedy Approach
    Definition:
        The greedy approach is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit or optimal solution at that moment. It does not reconsider the choices made previously.

    Key Characteristics:
        - Greedy choice property: A global optimal solution can be arrived at by choosing a local optimal solution.
        - Optimal substructure: A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.

    Examples:
        1. Activity Selection Problem:
            - Select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.
        2. Fractional Knapsack Problem:
            - Maximize the total value in the knapsack by taking fractions of items.
        3. Huffman Encoding:
            - Build an optimal prefix code for data compression.
        4. Dijkstra's Algorithm:
            - Find the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights.
