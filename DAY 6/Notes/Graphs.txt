Graphs
    Definition:
        A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes or vertices connected by edges.
        Each node may have multiple edges connecting it to other nodes.
    Examples:
        - Social networks
        - Web graphs
        - Traffic networks
        - Computer networks
        - Molecular structures
        - Gene expression networks
    Operations:
        - Traversal: Visit all nodes in a graph, following a specific order.
        - Search: Find a path between two nodes in a graph.
        - Shortest Path: Find the minimum-weight path between two nodes in a weighted graph.
        - Minimum Spanning Tree: Find the minimum-weight subgraph that connects all nodes in a weighted graph.
    Types:
        - Undirected Graphs: Edges are bidirectional and have no direction.
        - Directed Graphs (Digraphs): Edges have direction and represent a one-way relationship.
        - Weighted Graphs: Each edge has a weight or label associated with it.
        - Unweighted Graphs: Edges do not have weights or labels.
        - Cyclic Graphs: Contains at least one cycle.
        - Acyclic Graphs (DAGs): Does not contain any cycles.
