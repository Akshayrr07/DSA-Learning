Double Linked List

Definition:
A double linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains three parts:
1. Data: The actual data stored in the node.
2. Pointer to the next node in the sequence.
3. Pointer to the previous node in the sequence.

Structure:
Each node in a double linked list has the following structure:
- Data
- Next pointer (points to the next node)
- Previous pointer (points to the previous node)

Operations:
1. Insertion:
    - At the beginning
    - At the end
    - At a specific position
2. Deletion:
    - From the beginning
    - From the end
    - From a specific position
3. Traversal:
    - Forward traversal
    - Backward traversal
4. Searching:
    - Locate a specific element in the list.

Example of Operations:
- Insert a node with value 10 at the beginning.
- Delete the last node in the list.
- Traverse the list forward to display all elements.

Traversals:
1. Forward Traversal:
    Start from the head node and move to the next node until the end of the list.
2. Backward Traversal:
    Start from the tail node and move to the previous node until the beginning of the list.
