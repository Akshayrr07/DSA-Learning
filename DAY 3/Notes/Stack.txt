Stack

Definition:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Examples:
1. Undo functionality in text editors.
2. Browser backtracking (back button).
3. Expression evaluation in programming.

Approach:
- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
- Peek/Top: View the top element without removing it.
- IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

Features:
1. Operates on LIFO principle.
2. Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
3. Simple and efficient for certain use cases.

Advantages:
1. Easy to implement.
2. Efficient for managing function calls, recursion, and temporary data storage.
3. Useful in algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS).

Operations:
1. Push: Insert an element.
2. Pop: Remove the top element.
3. Peek: Retrieve the top element without removing it.
4. Size: Get the number of elements in the stack.
