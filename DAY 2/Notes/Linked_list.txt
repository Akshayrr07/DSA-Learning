Linked list
    Definition
        A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. 
        Each node contains two items: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. 
        This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

    Types of linked lists
        1. Singly Linked List
            - Each node contains a single link to the next node.
        2. Doubly Linked List
            - Each node contains two links: one to the next node and another to the previous node.
        3. Circular Linked List
            - The last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circle.

    Properties
        - Dynamic size: The size of a linked list can grow or shrink as needed.
        - Ease of insertion/deletion: Elements can be easily inserted or removed without reorganizing the entire structure.
        - Sequential access: Elements must be accessed sequentially starting from the head node.

    Disadvantages
        - Memory usage: Each node requires extra memory for storing the reference to the next node.
        - No random access: Elements cannot be accessed directly by index; traversal is required.
        - Complexity: Operations such as searching for an element can be slower compared to arrays due to the need for traversal.
