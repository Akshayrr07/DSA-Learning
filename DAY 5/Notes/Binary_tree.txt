Binary Tree

Definition:
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Example:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5

Operations:
1. Insertion: Add a node to the tree.
2. Deletion: Remove a node from the tree.
3. Traversal: Visit all nodes in a specific order (e.g., Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).
4. Search: Find a specific node in the tree.

Height:
The height of a binary tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

Depth:
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node.

Diameter:
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
